\usage{
compareBarcodes(
  from_resource,
  to_resource,
  spacerangerOut,
  format = c("mtx", "h5"),
  processing = c("raw", "filtered"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{from_resource}{\code{character(1)} The path to the resource file whose
barcodes are used as the basis of the comparison; typically, the "raw"
feature barcodes are used.}

\item{to_resource}{\code{character(1)} The path to the resource file whose
barcodes are compared to the \code{from_resource}; typically, the "filtered"
feature barcodes.}

\item{spacerangerOut}{\code{character(1)} A single string specifying the path to
the sample directory of \verb{spaceranger count}. The directory must contain the
\verb{(processing)_feature_bc_matrix} and \code{spatial} sub directories in addition
to the \code{outs} folder.}

\item{format}{The format of the output. If missing and \code{con} is a
file name, the format is derived from the file extension. This argument is
unnecessary when \code{con} is a derivative of \linkS4class{BiocFile}.}

\item{processing}{\code{character(2)} A vector of length 2 that corresponds to the
processing type. The processing types are typically "raw" and "filtered".
These are the prefixes of the folder names \code{raw_feature_bc_matrix} and
\code{filtered_feature_bc_matrix}. The order of the vector determines the
comparison. By default, \code{processing = c("raw", "filtered")}, which means
barcodes in the raw data are compared to the filtered data.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{TENxH5} or \code{TENxFileList}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with barcodes of the first element in the \code{processing}
data type as the first column and a logical vector indicating whether the
barcodes are found in the second element in \code{processing}. For example, if
processing is \code{c("raw", "filtered")}, then the first column will be the
barcodes in the \code{raw} data and the second column will be a logical vector
indicating whether the barcodes are found in the \code{filtered} data.
}
\description{
This function compares the barcodes between raw and filtered
data \strong{depending} on the order of \code{processing}. Typically, the "raw"
barcodes are compared to the "filtered" ones. The presence of raw
barcodes in the filtered data are marked as \code{TRUE} in the resulting
\code{data.frame}.
