\title{Compare barcodes between raw and filtered data}
\usage{
compareBarcodes(
  raw_filt_resources,
  spacerangerOut,
  processing = c("raw", "filtered"),
  outs = "outs",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw_filt_resources}{\code{character(2)} A vector of length 2, where the
first element is the path to the raw resources and the second element is
the path to the filtered resources. If the resources are already converted
to \code{TENxFileList} objects, then this argument can be a list of length 2,
where the first element is the raw resources and the second element is the
filtered resources.}

\item{spacerangerOut}{\code{character(1)} A scalar vector specifying the path
to the \code{spaceranger} output directory.}

\item{processing}{\code{character(2)} A vector of length 2 that corresponds to the
processing type. The processing types are typically "raw" and "filtered".
These are the prefixes of the folder names \code{raw_feature_bc_matrix} and
\code{filtered_feature_bc_matrix}.}

\item{outs}{\code{character(1)} A single string specifying the name of the
\code{spaceranger} output directory. Default is "outs".}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with barcodes of the first element in the \code{processing}
data type as the first column and a logical vector indicating whether the
barcodes are found in the second element in \code{processing}. For example,
if processing is \code{c("raw", "filtered")}, then the first column will be the
barcodes in the \code{raw} data and the second column will be a logical vector
indicating whether the barcodes are found in the \code{filtered} data.
}
\description{
This function compares the barcodes between raw and filtered
data \strong{depending} on the order of \code{processing}.
